    "# Sublime Lime's Line Graphs\n",
    "### In this project, you will be acting as a data analyst for an online lime retailer called Sublime Limes. People all over the world can use this product to get the freshest, best-quality limes delivered to their door. One of the product managers at Sublime Limes would like to gain insight into the customers and their sales habits. Using Matplotlib, youâ€™ll create some different line graphs (or maybe, lime graphs) to communicate this information effectively."
